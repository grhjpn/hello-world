# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Greg and I'm only just starting my coding journey. 

I'm originally from Glasgow, Scotland but now live in Japan. I currently work as an English teacher but I am hoping
to branch out into a new field, and tech might just be the answer.

As for experience, I'm working on a few simple courses via Codecademy and have enjoyed learning how to control the
command line and write scripts. My favourite command thus far is 'sleep', because it makes the terminal feel like
something from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'.

My short term goal is to become more confident writing scripts through practice. I want to put my degree in English
and creative writing to good use, so the first project I want to get started on is an interactive story script which
accepts simple user input and changes the narrative based on their response. Sort of like those old text-based games.

Pleased to meet you. よろしくお願いします。
